<!-- this file handles crawler tags for the / route.
it is called by server/serverroutes.js when the / route is hit by a crawler. -->

<!-- it basically means that server/serverroutes.js has been given the app special instructions
to check for the presence of crawlers when the / route is hit.
and if a crawler is detected, it renders on the server the content (below) and returns it.
note that this is not the entire page copy, since the crawlers are looking for specific tags only. -->

<!-- test it by doing a curl "http://localhost:3000" -H 'user-agent: facebookexternalhit/1.1'
where {valid project ID} is a valid project id. -->
