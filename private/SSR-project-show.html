<!-- this file handles crawler tags for the /projects/:projectID route.
it is called by server/serverroutes.js when the /projects/:projectID route is hit by a crawler. -->

<!-- it basically means that server/serverroutes.js has given the app special instructions
to check for the presence of crawlers when the /projects/:projectID route is hit.
and if a crawler is detected, it renders on the server the content (below) and returns it.
note that this is not the entire page copy, since the crawlers are looking for specific meta data only. -->

<!-- test it by doing a curl "http://localhost:3000/projects/p/:projectId/:slug" -H 'user-agent: facebookexternalhit/1.1'
where :projectId is a valid project id. -->
